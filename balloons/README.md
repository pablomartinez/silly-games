Balloon Puncher
===============

Basic Javascript game based on the engine live coded by Mary Rose Cook (http://vimeo.com/105955605). The interesting thing of this stupid game is that it doesn't use any Javascript libraries, just raw Javascript. I've tested it in recent Firefox and Chrome and it works.
